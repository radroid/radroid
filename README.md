# 👋 I'm Raj — Builder

I graduated from University in 2019 and have been on an adventure since. 

Today, I am looking for **full-stack engineer** or **product engineer** roles at **startups** and **mid-size** companies.

> **Background:** Nuclear Engineering → Data Scientist → Application Development → Technical Founder → Full-stack engineer

**Current:** Co-founder at [ARK Experiences](https://funwithark.ca) (competitive, outdoor, city experiences for communities, corporate events & tourists)

I'm a **full-stack developer with a product mindset** — I don't just ship features, I ship systems that solve real human problems.

I shipped a Next.js web application within a week for ARK experiences.

## 🧠 Philosophy

I believe the future belongs to **generalists who can work in teams to build systems**.

- Engineering teaches you **systems thinking**
- Startups teach you **speed & pragmatism**
- People teach you **what actually matters**

I'm not here to write the perfect algorithm. I'm here to build things that make life more memorable.
