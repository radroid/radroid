# 👋 I'm Raj — Generalist Builder

I architect **digital experiences** and design **physical adventures**. 

**Background:** Mechanical Engineering → Nuclear Energy → Full-Stack Development  
**Current:** Founder at [ARK Adventures](https://arkadventures.ca) (adventure experiences for 2000+ participants) | Building [Penguin Mail](https://github.com/radroid/penguin-mail) (email client for VCs)

I'm a **product manager with a developer brain** — I don't just ship features, I ship systems that solve real human problems.

## 🧠 Philosophy

I believe the future belongs to **generalists who can orchestrate systems**, not specialists who optimize within silos.

- Engineering teaches you **systems thinking**
- Startups teach you **speed & pragmatism**
- People teach you **what actually matters**

I'm not here to write the perfect algorithm. I'm here to build things that make life more memorable.
